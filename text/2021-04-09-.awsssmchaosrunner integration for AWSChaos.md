# Title

Integrating awsssmchaosrunner with chaos-mesh, as part of enriching aws-chaos

## Summary

This will be a kotlin based CLI to run the awsssmchaosrunner, controller of
awschaos will create a pod with that “kotlin cli image”, and send commands
to inject chaos into EC2 instances

## Motivation

awsssmchaosrunner, released by asw opensource provides various functionalities
to inject chaos in EC2 instance through SSM. Integrating it with chaos-mesh
would help us to add all the failure injections provided by awsssmchaosrunner
in chaos-mesh.

## Detailed design

There would be two parts to it

1. The kotlin based CLI: awsssmchaosrunner being a kotlin library, we need to
wrap it with a user-interface with functionalities of using SSM to inject the
chaos. This user-interface would then be containerized as a docker image.
2. The controller part: The controller for the aws chaos like other chaos in
chaos-mesh would be written in Golang and in turn will create a pod with kotlin
CLI image to send commands to inject the chaos.

## Drawbacks

- It will bring one big docker image for kotlin cli (about a hundred MiB with JVM)
- After digging in the awsssmchaosrunner project, the core logics are several
shell commands that inlined in the kotlin codes, that might be unmaintainable.

## Alternatives

We could rewrite the whole awsssmchaosrunner project into chaos-mesh one day,just
like what we do like AWS EC2 stop/restart chaos.
But that will take a long time to finish that, I think we will not do that at the
first time .
